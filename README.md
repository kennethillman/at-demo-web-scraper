# Web Scraper

An Active Talents Prrof of Concept

This is a POC of the use of a simpel web scraper working together with a static site generator, scheduled builds triggerd with webhooks from IFTTT (once a day) and github (on push to master branch).   
   
[DEMO HERE](https://at-demo-web-scraper.netlify.com/)  
   
* Nuxt.js (Development)
* Netlify  (Auto builds)
* IFTTT (Scheduled webhook)
* Github (Repo & webhook)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
